Any piece will do as long as you draw the grid(マス目を描けば駒は何でも良い)

## Movement of pieces(駒の移動)
* You can only act one arbitrary piece per turn(1ターンに任意の駒を一つだけ行動できる)
* People can only move forward(人は前方しか進めない)
  * However, if it overlaps with the road, you can only go in the direction of the road(しかし道と重なっていれば道の方向しか進めない)
  * However, if there are people on your side in the direction of progress, you cannot proceed(しかし進める方向に自分の人があれば進めない)
* The road cannot move(道は移動できない)
  * But it can rotate 90 degrees in any direction(しかし任意の方向に90度回転できる)
  * The road set by the other party can also rotate(相手が設置した道も回転可能)
* The ball advances in all directions(玉は八方に進める)
  * The ball is not affected by the road(玉は道の影響を受けない)

## After moving(駒の移動後の処理)
* If there is an opponent in that square, remove it from the game(相手の人が居た場合はゲームから除外)
  * The ball is not affected by the road(玉は道の影響を受けない)
